Practice servlets by building a Todo app.


# 📚 Learn Java Servlet - Todo List Web App

A beginner-friendly Java Servlet-based Todo List project that teaches you the fundamentals of server-side web development with Java EE and the Servlet API.

## 🌐 What is a Servlet?

> A **Servlet** is a Java class that runs on a web server and handles **HTTP requests and responses**.

Servlets act as a **controller layer** in a web application. They take client requests, process logic (like database access), and generate dynamic responses (like HTML).

---

## 🧩 What Problem Does a Servlet Solve?

Before Servlets, web servers relied on CGI (Common Gateway Interface) or native programs to generate dynamic content. These were:

- 🐢 Slow (each request created a new process).
- 🔁 Hard to maintain.
- ❌ Not scalable.

Java had no standard way to dynamically handle web requests until **Servlets** came in.

## 🧠 Servlet Lifecycle (Simplified)

1. **`init()`** – Called once when the servlet is initialized.
2. **`doGet()` / `doPost()`** – Called for every request (e.g., from forms or URLs).
3. **`destroy()`** – Called when the servlet is removed from service.

## 🧰 What Can a Servlet Do?

- Handle form submissions
- Manage session data (cookies, user sessions)
- Connect to databases
- Generate dynamic content (HTML, JSON, XML)
- Redirect and forward requests

## 💡 Why Use Servlets?
### Feature	Benefit
- Performance	Single thread pool — not process-based like CGI
- Reusability	Write once, run anywhere in any container
- Scalability	Easily scales with web server
- Extensibility	Can integrate with JSP, Spring, etc.
- Portability	Runs on any Java-enabled server


## 🧪 Real-World Example: Todo List App
Imagine you're building a Todo List:

- User submits a form to add a task.

- A Servlet receives that data (doPost()), adds it to the list.

- Then it forwards the request to a JSP page to display updated tasks.

- Without a Servlet, you'd have no clean, Java-based way to do this backend logic in a web app.
```
A Servlet is a Java class that runs on a server and handles web requests.

It solves the problem of writing dynamic, scalable, and maintainable Java web applications.

It’s the foundation of Java EE web development, often used with JSP, JSTL, and frameworks like Spring.```
